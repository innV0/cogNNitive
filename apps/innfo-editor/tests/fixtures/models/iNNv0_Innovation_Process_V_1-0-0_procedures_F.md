# _NN procedureThe iNNv0 innovation process is an early-stage innovation management framework structured in two dimensions: **Design** (strategic foundations) and **Execution** (tactical implementation). It focuses on identifying and implementing high-value innovation opportunities with minimal resources, enabling organizations to start building innovation capacity immediately.The process follows a sequential path: assess maturity, describe the organization, plan innovation management, design programs, manage opportunities, and track initiatives. Each step feeds into the next, with AI-powered tools accelerating diagnostics, opportunity identification, ideation, and process optimization.
# _NN roles
* _NN roles: Innovation Manager
```yaml
  scope: internal
```
Drives the overall innovation process, coordinates across dimensions, and ensures alignment with strategic goals.
* _NN roles: Team Member
```yaml
  scope: internal
```
Participates in assessments, ideation, and execution of innovation initiatives within the organization.
* _NN roles: External Consultant
```yaml
  scope: external
```
Provides specialized expertise, facilitates maturity assessments, and guides program design from an outside perspective.
* _NN roles: Stakeholder
```yaml
  scope: external
```
Sponsors innovation efforts, provides strategic direction, and validates outcomes against business objectives.
# _NN work
1. _NN work: Assess Innovation Maturity
```yaml
  step_type: task
  next: Describe Organization
  tool: assessmeNNt
  output: Maturity Assessment Report
  output_status: final
```
Conduct a focused diagnosis using the assessmeNNt tool to determine the organization's current state of maturity in innovation management. AI-powered assessment forms enable quick, accurate diagnostics.
2. _NN work: Describe Organization
```yaml
  step_type: task
  next: Plan Innovation Management
  input: Maturity Assessment Report
  tool: organizatioNN
  output: Organization Description Document
  output_status: final
```
Analyze the current business model, organizational culture, and key capabilities using the organizatioNN tool. Establishes the baseline for strategic planning.
3. _NN work: Plan Innovation Management
```yaml
  step_type: task
  next: Design Innovation Programs
  input: Organization Description Document
  tool: plaNN
  output: Innovation Management Plan
  output_status: final
```
Create a simple, actionable strategic roadmap using the plaNN tool to elevate the organization's innovation maturity level. Aligns innovation efforts with company vision and goals.
4. _NN work: Design Innovation Programs
```yaml
  step_type: task
  next: Manage Opportunities
  input: Innovation Management Plan
  tool: desigNN
  output: Program Design Document
  output_status: final
```
Structure the initial tactical programs that will drive innovation using the desigNN tool. Defines scope, resources, and expected outcomes for each program.
5. _NN work: Identify and Manage Opportunities
```yaml
  step_type: task
  next: Track and Execute Initiatives
  input: Program Design Document
  tool: opportuNNities
  output: Opportunities Registry
  output_status: final
```
Systematically identify obvious and easily accessible innovation opportunities using the opportuNNities tool. AI processes large volumes of data to pinpoint high-value, low-risk opportunities.
6. _NN work: Track and Execute Initiatives
```yaml
  step_type: task
  input: Opportunities Registry
  tool: iNNitiatives
  output: Initiative Tracking Board
  output_status: draft
```
Use agile tracking to develop selected opportunities into concrete projects using the iNNitiatives tool. AI assists with ideation, process optimization, and reduces the learning curve.

Vinyl Records Inc. is an independent record label founded in 2015, specializing in high-quality vinyl reissues of classic jazz and rock albums. We bridge the gap between legacy catalog owners and audiophile collectors through premium packaging, mastered-from-original-tapes production, and curated direct-to-fan distribution.
